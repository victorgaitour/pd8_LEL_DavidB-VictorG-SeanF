======================
Possible Ideas:

Chat application

AI system that speaks with you (kind of like cleverbot.com)

Encryption and key- makes encrypted language for you.

Data set visualizers, makes a model of the data set and then allows you to interact with it. For example it could model out a binary tree and then have a function that makes it so that you can click the node and make it do something like remove it or move it to other nodes and then it will do the same thing on the back end and actually remove the node from the Tree. (kind of like that mathemathica thing that we saw)

Game such as tower defense that uses a linked list as a path. Can also be snake or something else.


etc.
