pd8_LEL_DavidB-VictorG-SeanF 
======================
The Project:
---------
Our project is a data structure and data set visualizer.  It begins with command line interface, where you can choose to enter the data from a csv file or from the command line.  By following the specific format that this project requires, the user is actually inputing their data into an underlying ArrayList.  Once the data has been entered, the user can choose between a host of data structures to visualize his or her data.  The user can also choose to see the data in either a bar graph or a pie chart (we used jfreechart here). Our main class is LEL.java (it has an inner Gui class). You may ask, why LEL? Well, we don't know.

**Compiling/running:**

At first try:

javac -classpath "lib/jfreechart-1.0.17.jar:jcommon-1.0.22/jcommon-1.0.22.jar:." LEL.java -Xlint

java -classpath "lib/jfreechart-1.0.17.jar:jcommon-1.0.22/jcommon-1.0.22.jar:." LEL

If that doesnâ€™t work, you need to download jcommon version 1.0.22 and jfreechart 1.0.17 for this.  Once you download the .zip files, you need to unpack them.  If you have Linux or Unix, while in the directory of the downloaded zip file, enter "tar xvzf jfreechart-1.0.17.zip" into the terminal.  Then enter "tar xvzf jcommon-1.0.22.zip" to unpack jcommon.  If you have Windows, enter "jar -xvf jfreechart-1.0.13.zip" to unpack jfreechart, then enter "jar -xvf jcommon-1.0.22.zip" to unpack jcommon.

Once you have unpacked these two files, you should see a folder for each of them, one titled "jfreechart-1.0.17" the other titled "jcommon-1.0.22".  Move both of these files into the pd8_LEL_DavidB-VictorG-SeanF directory, or whatever directory you have for this project.  Next, enter the jfreechart-1.0.17 folder and find a folder called "lib".  Take this folder and also place it into the pd8_LEL_DavidB-VictorG-SeanF directory.

Now you have all the .jar files in place for this project.  Some files use jfreechart, others don't, but this command should work to compile any (NOTE: if you have Windows, replace the colons in the following statement with semicolons):

javac -classpath "lib/jfreechart-1.0.17.jar:jcommon-1.0.22/jcommon-1.0.22.jar:." LEL.java -Xlint

(javac -classpath "lib/jfreechart-1.0.17.jar;." LEL.java -Xlint) (may also work)

In case you were worrying about the warnings, we assure you, no computers nor people will be harmed, most likely.

*To run:*

java -classpath "lib/jfreechart-1.0.17.jar:jcommon-1.0.22/jcommon-1.0.22.jar:." LEL

(java -classpath "lib/jfreechart-1.0.17.jar;." LEL) (may also work)

If, for some reason, this doesn't work, it technically only affects the chart making.  By entering LEL.java (the driver file) and commenting out any import statement the begins with "org.jfree." and the entirety of the "else if (choice2 == 8)" block, the code should work with limited functionality. (Choices 1-7 will likely functions fine, with only the graphs and charts having problems).

NOTE: Some compile errors have arisen amongst the three of us that have left us completely confused.  Not to say the project doesn't work -- it does, but each of us have gotten a different error at a different part of the code, using the same code.  An error in one file is caught on one member's computer, while it works fine on someone else's, and vice versa with other code bits.  For this reason, you might get an error with one or more parts of this project.  If so, look to the LEL.java file and comment out the specified blocks of code in order to use the rest of the project.
